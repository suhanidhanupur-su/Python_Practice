## what , where, who, when, why 

5W things . 

1. what is Python?
=> Python is a high level interpreted Programming Language. 

## THere are two types of Programming Language

1. High Level Language :
=> it is software oriented.
=> it is used in Web devlopment, data science , game devlopment, app devlopment etc.
EXAMPLE : Python, Java , c++ etc.

2. Low Level Language :
=> it is hardware oriented.
=> it is used in Washing Machine, Induction, Keyboard, mouse , Joystick etc .

EXAMPLE : C , Assembly Language, Machine Language etc.  

Operating System : it builds relation or connection between hardware and software. 

=> by using C Language we can build Operating system.



2. where , when, and who 
## where Python was devloped?
## who devloped?
## when it was devloped?

=> Guido Van Rossum devloped Python in February 1991.
in Neitherland. 


the task is we have to print Hello Wilmot.

## why:
1. it is easy to learn and use. 
2. it is easy to read and understand.
3. it is used in web devlopment, app devlopment,
data science, Machine learning, etc.
4. it is cross platform(Operating system). 
=> when we build a website using Python language , then it can be opened in Windows as well as mac Operating sytem. 

5. it has a large ecosystem.
=> it has many frmaework or library ( Django, Flask, NumPy, Pandas etc.)


Day : 2 
## Programming Language :- 

=> Programming language is a formal language that devlopers use to communicate with computers.

=> there are 2 types of Language:

1. Complied Language :
=> it runs the whole at a time.
=> it takes less time to run.
=> it is hard to debug.
EXAMPLE: Java etc .

2. interpreted Language :
=> it runs the code line by line .
=> it takes more time to run .
=> it is easy to debug.
EXAMPLE: Python etc.


* DEBUG : it's the process of finding erros.


## APPLICation :

=> APPLICation is a type of software , that is used to devloped to perform any specific task .

=> it can run on any mobile devices , computers, and even any web browsers.

## browsers : Micrsoft Edge, Safari, Google CHrome, Firefox , Opera mini

## APPLICation TYpes :
1. Web APPLICation
2. Mobile APPLICation
3. Desktop APPLICation

1. Web APPLICation: -
=> It runs inside web browsers.
=> it requires any internet connection.
=> it is platform independent(Operating system).
=> No need to install.

EXAMPLE : google translator, Youtube, etc.

2. Mobile APPLICation:
=> it is devloped to run on smartphones, tabletst.

=> there are 3 types of mobile APPLICation

(a) Mobile web APPLICation :
=> there are so many apps, that run in mobile inside any web browser.
=> access via url
=> it is platform independent.
=> it requires any internet connection.

EXAMPLE: google doc, google sheet. 

(b) Native APPLICation:-
=> it is platform dependent. 
=> it is devloped for a particular platform(Operating system).
=> installed from app store and play store.
=> Full access to device features ( Camera, GPS, Notification)
EXAMPLE: App store, Play store .

(c) Hybrid Application :-
=> it's combination of Mobile web Application and Native application.
=> it is platform independent.
=> it can run as a app or as a website.

EXAMPLE: Youtube, Instagram, Facebook, Whatsapp.


Day : 3 
—--------------------------------------- Python Varialbes ----------------------------------------------------- 
## what is Variable?
=> it is just like a container , that store some values.
It occupies some space in memory.
EXAMPLE: a, b, my_variable etc.

Water Bottle => just like container , it contains some quantity of water .


, Maths 

x = 10
x = Variable and 10 is the value 

## there are some rules to declare a Variable.

1. Variable name can contain letters, numbers and underscore.
Ex: a, name, a_b, name_1, name_2 etc.

2. Variable name must starts with a letter or underscore.

Ex:
1_value = 17  => Wrong 
Value_33 = 777  => right 
_first_name = "SHarik" => rigte
first_1_name = "WIlmot" => right 

3. Variable name are case-sensitive.
EX: 

first_student_name  ="WIlmot"
FIRST_student_name = "SHarik"
print(FIRST_student_name)


NOte: Python is a case sensitive language.
Lower case (a,b,c,d.....) & Upper case (ABCDE........)

4. Keywords are not allowed to declare a variable. 

NOtes: Keywords are the words , that are predefined in Programming language. 

there are 32 Keywords in Python language.
EXAMPLE: print, if, else, and, or, while, for, break, continue etc. 

5. Variable should have meaningful name for better readability.

EXAMPLE: 
s_name = "Wilmot"
student_name = "Sharik"
print(student_name)



TASK : Explore what is Git and Github 
=> what is the difference bwtween Git and Github .
=> how to install git bash
=> hot to create credential on Github.


—---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
my_variable = 12
# my_variable is variable and 12 is the value 
print(my_variable)

name = "Wilmot"
print(name)

# the task is we have print Wilmot 


# which is variable , and which is value .


first_name = "Shashant"
last_name = "Pandey"

value_1 = 13
# 1_value = 15 
# print(1_value)
print(value_1)

print(first_name)

first_student_name  ="WIlmot"

FIRST_student_name = "SHarik"

print(FIRST_student_name)

# else = 88
# print(else)

s_name = "Wilmot"
student_name = "Sharik"
print(student_name)

Day: 4

### How to setp Git and Github ?

Step: Git download locally  , and setup following this video https://youtu.be/t2-l3WvWvqg?si=onv6-lvbbFrqGLSs
Setup Github , and create Username and password ( credential)
Open cmd , and check for version 
=> git - - version
=> git config --global user.name "enter your username"
git config --global user.email "enter your email"


git config --global user.email
git config --global user.name

10 . Create a new folder on desktop 

And double click on that folder and at the top where path is showing 

, we delete the folder path and write down cmd
And press enter button 
When it opens in cmd , we have to write (“code .“)

, now this folder can open in VS code .

Step: 1=> firstly we have to create a file , and write some lines of code 
Step 2 => click on NEW terminal 
Step 2.1 => open github and create new REPOSETRIES , and provide a name , and follow the commands 
Step 3 => git init  (“connect folder with github”)
Step 4 => git add . ( “add all files to commit ”) 
(“for single file commit ,we use git add nav.html”)
Step 5 => git status (“we can see status like which files are committed on git”)
Step 6 => git commit -m “first commit”
Step 7 => rest of commands 

—--------------------------------------------------------------
## How to add new  file in our existed repo?

Step: 1=> git add “file name”  OR git add .
Step 2 => git commit -m “your message”
Step 3 => git push -u origin main

## Operators:
=> it can perform any specific operation between two values/Operands.


4 + 5 => it can perform addition 
4 * 5 => it can perform multiplication 

=> 4 and  5 => are values/Operands 
=> +, *, - =>  are the operators



Types of Operators:
1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Assignment Operators
3. Comparison Operators
4. Logical Operators
5. Bitwise Operators
6. Membership Operators
7. Identity Operators
# ------------------------------------------------ 

1. Arithmetic Operators:
=> it is used to perform mathematical operations between two values/Operands.

Operators: +, -, *, /, %, //, **

+ => Addition
- => Subtraction
* => Multiplication
/ => Division
% => Modulus
// => Floor Division
** => Exponentiation

3**6 => 3^6 => 3*3*3*3*3*3 => 729

4**2 => 4*4 = 16


## Division operator ("/") => it gives us Quient value.
=> it includes the decimal part.

Ex: 3.5, 4.6, 4.1, 2.5 etc. 

## Floor Division ("//") => it gives us Quient value.
=> it removes the decimal part .

## Modulus ("%") => it gives us the remainder part .


2. Assignment Operator : =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, **=
# = => Assignment
# += => Add and Assign
# -= => Subtract and Assign
# *= => Multiply and Assign             
# /= => Divide and Assign
# %= => Modulus and Assign
# //= => Floor Divide and Assign
# **= => Exponent and Assign


x = 20
y = 5
# x += y  
x = x + y 
print(x)



3. Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, **=

x = 20
y = 5
# x += y  
x = x + y 
print(x)


# the task is we wanna add in x => both  X and Y 
# x = x + y => it takes more time to run 
# x += y  => it takes less time to run 
# print(x + y) 

# in future we will learn about Time complexity, Space complexity

4. Comparison Operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
# ------------------------ 
# => in this case we will get the output in boolean format => True, False

5. Logical Operators: and, or, not

# and => both the conditions should be true
# or => any one condition should be true
# not => negates the condition



6. Bitwise Operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>

# & =>  Bitwise AND
# | =>  Bitwise OR           
# ^ =>  Bitwise XOR
# ~ =>  Bitwise NOT

0 => 0000
1=> 0001

## New topic 
## String Indexing:- 
=> Index starts form 0 

my_name = "Wilmot"


0 1 2 3 4 5
W i l m o t

print(my_name[2])

Task: Please Expore String indexing 



Day: 10




##  topic 
## String Indexing (Positive Indexing):- 
=> Index starts form 0 

my_name = "Wilmot"

0 1 2 3 4 5
W i l m o t

print(my_name) => Wilmot
print(my_name[2]) => l


## String Indexing (Negative Indexing):- 


my_name = "Wilmot"



 W  i  l  m  o  t
-6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1



## String Slicing:-

=> in string slicing , there are 2 or  3 parameters in input .


=>firstly we will learn only 2 parameters slicing concept .
=> 1. Starting/initial  point
=> 2. Ending Point

NOte:-
=> By default starting point will be 0.
=> By default ending point will be last index.
=> ending point will be excluded.

i just want to cut mo

my_name = "Wilmot"
print(my_name[3:5])
print(my_name[ : ])
print(my_name[ 2: ])
print(my_name[ : 4])  staring point = 0 , ending point = 4
 =>                   wilm
print( my_name[ 2:3])

print(my_name[1:-1]) => ilmo

0 1 2 3 4 5
W i l m o t


 W  i  l  m  o  t
-6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1



, NOw we'll see 3 parameters input in String slicing.
=> first parameter => starting point
=> second parameter => Ending point
=> 3rd parameter => GAP (n-1)

NOte: By default gap = 1.

if gap = 1 => it becomes (n-1) => 1-1 = 0
if gap =2  => it becomes 1
if gap 

0 1 2 3 4 5
W i l m o t


 W  i  l  m  o  t
-6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1


str_value = "Programming"

0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10
P  r  o  g  r  a  m  m  i  n  g

in this string at which index , g is present first time.

print("with gap3 output is : ", str_value[0: 9: 3])


starting point => 0
ending point => 9
gap => 3 , it becomes => 2
=> Output : P g m


## input method : 
=> it is used to take data from user. 

Ex: 
a = 10 
b = 20
print(a + b)

=> 30



first_name = input("Enter your first name: ")
last_name = input("Enter your last name: ")

print(first_name + " " + last_name)


  
  
first_value = int(input("enter the first value"))
second_value = int(input("enter the second value"))

print(first_value + second_value)




# a = 10 
# b = 20
# print(a + b)

first_name = input("Enter your first name: ")
last_name = input("Enter your last name: ")

print(first_name + " " + last_name)

print("without gap output is : ", my_name[0: 5])
print("without gap2 output is : ", my_name[0: 5: 2])
print("without gap output is : ", my_name[0: 5])
print("with gap3 output is : ", str_value[0: 9: 3])


—------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

my_string = "Programming"
print("the output of find is : ", my_string.find("g"))  # 3
print("the output of count is : ", my_string.count("g"))  # 3

## why => First impression( Jo dikhega whi Bikega)



2. Backend => the part of web development that deals with server side logic.

## Technology:-
=> Python(Django,Flask,Pandas,NumPy) , JavaScript(Node.js), Java(Springboot), Php(Laravel). 


3. Database :-
=> it is used to store our data in the structured form .
=> it handles security issues.
=> Example: MySQL, PostgreSQL(PgSQL), MongoDB 
=> for database we use Structured Query language.

# Extends => using extend() method , we can add multiple element at the end of list.

# 3. insert => we can add any element at specified index. 

# 4. remove() => we can remove/delete any element from a list 

# 5. pop() => using pop() , you can delete last index element or specified index element.

## 6. index() => using this method we can find index of any element.  

## 7. count() => it gives the number of occurence of specifed element in a list.

## 8. sort() => by using this method, we can sort our list , in any order asending order or descending order. 
# => by default it gives asecending order .

## reverse() => by using this method , we can reverse our list. 

## copy() => we can copy all elemente from one list to another list.

## conditional statement :-
# => 

# if , else, if-elif-else, Nested if 

# first_value = 10
# second_value = 5

# else: 
#  print("second value is greater")





# NOte: if condition is true then it runs the code of if statement otherwise it runs the code of else statement .

# Indentation => Indentation is backbone of Python language.

# NOte:  no need to write condition in parentheses in any conditon in python  it is optional

 print("c is equal to 30 , Okay! WIlmot")

Day: 14


input() function => it is used to take data from the user side.

=> by default it gives me  string value 
that's why we have to specify data type what we want in output.

## even number => it can be divisible by 2. 
=> EX: 20, 30, 10

20/2 => remainder = 0
11/2 => remainder = 1

=> in Airthmatic operator , Modulus ("%") => it gives remainder value.



## Nested if => an if condition inside any other if condition.


## Nested BOx : a box inside another box.

## Loop :-

# A loop is a programming construct that repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
## WHat is loop?
=> whenever we have to perform any repeated task, 
we should prefer loop.

Types:-

Task: We have to print SHarik 5 times.

for( int i = 0; i < 5; i++){
printf("Sharik");
}



int i = 0 => step: 1 => Initialization 
i < 5 ; => step : 2 => check condition here 
printf("Sharik") => step: 3 => perform any task 
i++ => step: 4 => increment by 1

PHASE 1:-
=> initially i = 0;
=> we check condition i < 5 => True 
=> so we can enter in the loop and perform any task
=> the we can increment i by 1
 
PHASE 2:-
=> i becomes , => i = 1 
=> we check condition i < 5 => 1 < 5 => True
=> now we can enter the loop and perform any task
=> we need to increment i by 1 

PHASE 3:-
=> i becomes , i => 2
=> we check condition i < 5; , 2 < 5 => True
=> now we can enter the loop and perform any task
=> we need to increment i by 1 

PHASE: 4 
=> i becomes , i = 3
=> we check condition i < 5 , 3 < 5 => True
=> now we can enter the loop and perform any task
=> we need to increment i by 1 

PHASE: 5
=> i becomes , i = 4
=> we check condition i < 5 , 4 < 5 => True 
=> now we can enter the loop and perform any task
=> we need to increment i by 1 


Phase : 6
=> i becomes , i = 5
=> we check condition, i < 5 , 5 < 5 => False 
=> we can not enter in loop , or you can we exit from loop.

how to print 10 even number ?

% => it gives remainder by using division operartion.

12 =>   12 % 2 => remainder = 0
14 =>   14 % 2 => remainder = 0
80 =>   80 % 2 => remainder = 0

the variable is n => if (n % 2 == 0 )=> it is even number otherwise it is odd number.

19 => 19 % 2 => remainder = 1



for i in range( 0, 5):
    print ( i)

0 => starting point , by default value (0)
5 => ending point , it will be excluded.


for i in range(2,19,3):

NOte: whenever you have access each and every element of any sequence using for loop, then the loop variable follow the indexing concept.


## while loop:-

i = 1




a = 10 
b = 7

a = a + 3   , OR    a = 10 + 3 => 13

a += 3  OR a = a + 3 => both are similar things.

a = a + 3 => it takes more time to run.
a += 3 => it takes less time to run.


# Time complexity:-

=> time taken by any code to run is called time complexity.

## SPace complexity :-
=> space taken by any code to run is called space complexity.



## Water Container => it contains some quantity of water. 
=> and it takes some space in your room.

## Variable  => it is just like a container , that store some value.

1's complement :-


a = 12 , the binary number of 12 => 1100

then 1's complement(opposite) of 1100 :-

    1 1 0 0 
---------------
    0 0 1  1   => 1's complement of 1100 ( 12)


if we have find the 2's complement of any number :-

=> 2's complement = 1's complement + 1


step.1: 1's complement of 1100 is 0011

step.2 :  add 1 in 1's complement 

=>   0 0 1 1
        +  1      carry = 1, carry = 1
---------------
     0 1 0 0   = 2's complement of 1100 ( 12 )

6   =>  00006  => yes


Q. a = 12

   print("The value of ~a is: ", ~a)


=>  the binary number of 12 => 1100

   1100 => it can be written like this => 00001100

as we know bitwise not operator is just like 1's complement 


0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0

---------------- 
1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1


NOTE: if left most bit is 1 => it considers in Negative numbers.
and if left most bit is 0 , then u can consider it positive number.


,NOTE:  whenever you find negative number then you have to perform 2's complement 



1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1  => find the 2's complement 


as we know 2'complement  = 1's complement + 1


1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1

# my_name[5] = "p"

# print(my_name)



# 0 1 2 3 4 5
# W I l m o t  

# W i l m o p


Mutable : in this case we can change entirely or any specific element .
Example : List, Dictionary ..


Immutable : in this case we can change only entirely , we can't change any specifc element .

# # Example: string , tuple etc.



# my_name = "WIlmot"

# print(my_name[5])

# print(my_name)

# my_name = "Sharik"

# print("after entirely changes ",my_name) 

# # tuple:- 
A tuple in Python is an ordered, immutable (cannot be changed), and indexable collection of elements.

You can store different data types (integers, strings, lists, etc.) inside a tuple.

it is also immutable data strucutre.

Example: ( 11, 22, 33, 44)

# 5. update() => you can add one more new field or you can update any existed field .

# 6. pop()  => using this method we can remove any data from a list.
# Note:  pop expected at least 1 argument

# => pop("name")

# 7. popitem() => it can remove last key pair value.

# 8. clear() => by using this method , we can remove entire element from a dictionary.

# in Python , we say Dictionary
# in c and C++ , we say it map ( ordered map and unordered map)
# in javascript , we say it objects

# # set :-

# => it's a collection of unique elements.
# => it can't contain duplicate elements.
# => it is similar to list but only one difference is it can not contain duplicate element 
# => it is also mutable.
# => it is unordered (elements have no fixed position),

# # EX: { 22,34,55,66,77,88 }

# # tuple : (22,33,44,55,)
# # list : [ 33,44,55,66,77]

# #   0  1  2  3   4  5   6  7
# # { 22,34,55,66,77,88, 55, 55 }

# # my_set = { 22,34,55,66,77,88, 55, 55 }

# # => it gives error , because it's indexing will be unbalanced , after removing the duplicate elements



# # my_set = { 22,34,55,66,77,88, 110, 200 }
# # print(my_set)  
# # my_set.add(202)

# # print("my new set looks like this : ", my_set)

# # 1. add() => using this method , we can add any element at any random index.

# # print("my new set looks like this : ", my_set)
# # my_set.remove(111) # error : because 111 does not exist in set.
# # print(my_set)


# # discard() :-
# # => by using this method , we can discard any specific eleement , and if that element does not exist then it just ignore ,and does not give any error.

Identity operator : -

=> it is looking for address of elementes not the elements.
it compares the address of elements not the values or elements.


                  0   1      2    3     => indexes

Garbage Value = Address
Exmaple:  Random Value in ordered form ( 1000, 1001, 1002, 1003)

Garbage Value means a random, undefined value stored in a variable when memory is allocated but no initial value is assigned.

=> the main advantage of function is code reusability.
=> once we define a function, we can call it multiple times.
that's how we can save our time and effort.
=> it enahnces code readability.                                                                                                                              function => it's the block of code. 

=> and we can use it whenever we want.
=> we can save our time and effort.

# how to define a function in python =>

# function definition syntax :-
def Wilmot_function():
    print("This is Suhani")


Wilmot_function()  # function call

# 1. def => it is keyword to define a function.
# 2. Wilmot_function => it is the name of function.

# 3. () => parentheses are used to pass parameters to function.

# 4. : => colon is used to indicate the start of function body.

# 5. print("This is Suhani") => it is the content  of function.

# in c languages , we define

# function  Wilmot_function()
# {
#     print("This is Suhani")

# function:-

# 1. function definition 
# 2. function call

# 1. what is function definition?
# => a function definition is where you create a function.

# Example:-
# def my_function_name():
#                     print("thias is my function")

# 2. what is function call?
# => a function call is when you use a function after define it.


# def my_function_name():
#                     print("thias is my function")




# my_function_name()  # function call

# there are 2 types of function in python:

# 1. in-built function OR pre-defined function
# 2. user-defined function

# #### in-built function OR pre-defined function => no need to define it , we can directly use it.
# Example: print(), input(), len(), type() etc.


# print("suhani")

# print(sum([1,2,3,4,5])) ## 15 , sum is in-built function

# # this is user defined function 
# def sharik_function():
#     print("this is sharik function")


# sharik_function()  # function call



# print(max([1,9992,23,40,55]))  ## 9992 , max is in-built function
# print(len("suhani"))  ## 6 , len is in-built function
# print(min([1,2,3,4,5]))  ## 1 , min is in-built function


# 8 => integer
# 8.9 => float
# "suhani" => string
# True/False => boolean
#  type(), max(), min()  ## pre-defined function
# print(type(8))  ## <class 'int'>  # pre-defined function
# print(type(8.9))  ## <class 'float'>  # pre-defined function
# print(type("suhani"))  ## <class 'str'>  # pre-defined function
# print(type(True))  ## <class 'bool'>  # pre-defined function



# print( ), input(), len(),


# 2. user-defined function => we have to define it firstly, then we can use it.


# def my_function():
#                     my_name = "Wilmot"
#                     print(my_name*5)

    my_variable = int(input("HIi, Wilmot please enter any number to find sqr: "))
    print("hii WImot here is your sqr: ",my_variable * my_variable)

find_square()


889 % 2 => 1
99 % 2 => 1  => odd number

88 % 2 = 0
12 % 2 = 0  => even number 
14 % 2 = 0  => even number 


def check_even_odd(x):
   
    if x % 2 == 0:
             print("this is even number ")
    else:
             print("this is odd number ")
  


def print_table_of_Thirteen(x):
    for i in range(x, x*10+1, x)

# task : write a program to check if a person is eligible for voting


age = int(input("Hii GUYS! Enter your age: "))

if age >= 18 :

        print("yes , you are eligible to vote")
     
else: 
     print("you are not eligigble to vote")




age = int(input("Hii GUYS! Enter your age: "))

citizen = input("enter your citizership: ")

if age >= 18 :

        if citizen == "indian":
           print("yes , you are eligible to vote")
        else:
           print("sorry, you must be an Indian to vote")
     
else: 
     print("you are not eligigble to vote")

score = int(input("Enter your score: "))

if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("Grade: B")
elif score >= 70:
    print("Grade: C")


else:
    print("Grade: F")

for i in range(0, 2):    ##  2 times 

    print("this is my first for loop")

    for j in range(0,1):   ## 1 time 

        print("the value of i: ", i, "the value of j:", j)



this is my first for loop
the value of i:0 the value of j:0


this is my first for loop
the value of i:1, the value of j:0

Concept : Nested IF 



for i in range(0, 3):
    print(i)


starting point => 0
ending point => 3 , excluded
output => 0,1,2


Nested Loop => loop inside another loop.



in 1st for loop:
starting point => 0 
ending point => 3 , excluded


for i in range(0, 2):    ##  2 times 

    print("this is my first for loop")
    for j in range(0,1):   ## 1 time

        print("the value of i: ", i, "the value of j:", j)


Phase 1
starting point => 0 , value of i 
ending point => 3 , excluded
=> condition check ( 0 < 3) TRUE
=> perform task , inside loop 
=> value of i = 0  ----------------------

first task : print("this is my first for loop")
second task : 

## inside 2nd for loop 
staring point => 0
ending point => 1
=> value of j = 0 ----------------


value of i is incremented by 1 , i++ , 0 + 1 => 1


staring point => 1 , value of i 
ending point => 2 
check condition ( i < 2) , 1< 2 => TRUE
=> enter in the loop 
=> 1st task: print("this is my first for loop")
=> 2nd task: run second loop
